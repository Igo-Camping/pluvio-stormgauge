## Quick start (local preview)

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

## Operator configuration

Stormgauge reads optional overrides from `window.STORMGAUGE_CONFIG`. Default configuration is neutral — no operator-specific paths are shipped with the public deploy. To customise for a deployment, copy `stormgauge-config.example.js` and load it via a `<script>` tag **before** the main inline script.

See `docs/OPERATIONS.md` for the deploy and branch model.
